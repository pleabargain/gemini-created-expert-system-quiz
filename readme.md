Okay, here is a `README.md` file for the script.

# Simple IT Career Advisor Expert System

## Overview

This Python script simulates a basic expert system designed to provide general advice on IT career progression. It interacts with the user through a command-line interface (CLI), asking a series of multiple-choice questions about their experience level, goals, and learning preferences. Based on the answers, it generates simple, rule-based advice and logs the entire interaction (user input, questions, answers, final advice) into a timestamped JSON file.

The script can also be used to load and display the contents of these previously saved JSON log files.

**Note:** This script was developed as an example within AI Studio at Google.

## Features

*   **Interactive Q&A:** Guides the user through questions relevant to IT career planning.
*   **Multiple-Choice Input:** Simplifies user interaction via predefined options.
*   **Basic Rule-Based Advice:** Generates suggestions based on a static set of rules matching user answers.
*   **JSON Logging:** Saves each session's details, including a unique session ID, timestamp, interactions, and advice, to a `.json` file (e.g., `IT-career-advice-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json`).
*   **Log Loading:** Provides a command-line option to load and view existing JSON session logs.
*   **Input Validation:** Includes a basic check to ensure the user's initial request is related to IT careers.
*   **Usage Instructions:** Offers built-in help via `--help` and provides tips during execution.

## Requirements

*   **Python 3.x** (Developed and tested with Python 3.7+)
*   **Standard Libraries:** The script relies on built-in Python libraries:
    *   `json` (for handling JSON data)
    *   `datetime` (for timestamps)
    *   `uuid` (for unique session IDs)
    *   `argparse` (for command-line argument parsing - standard since Python 3.2)
    *   `sys` (for system-specific parameters and functions)
    *   `os` (for operating system interactions, like getting the script name)

No external packages need to be installed via `pip`.

## Usage

1.  Save the script to a file (e.g., `it_advisor.py`).
2.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the script.

### Running Interactively

To start a new advice session:

```bash
python it_advisor.py
```

The script will:
*   Display a welcome message and usage tips.
*   Prompt you for your "decision space" (your goal, e.g., "advice on IT career").
*   Ask multiple-choice questions.
*   Display generated advice.
*   Print the session log in JSON format to the console.
*   Save the session log to a file named `IT-career-advice-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` in the current directory.

### Loading a Previous Session Log

To view the contents of a previously saved JSON log file:

```bash
python it_advisor.py --load-json <filename.json>
```

Replace `<filename.json>` with the actual path to the log file.

**Example:**

```bash
python it_advisor.py --load-json IT-career-advice-20231027-153000.json
```

The script will read the specified JSON file and print its formatted contents to the console.

### Getting Help

To see the available command-line options and usage instructions:

```bash
python it_advisor.py --help
```

## Limitations

*   **Static Advice:** The advice provided is based on a **fixed set of simple rules** coded directly into the script. It does not use advanced AI, machine learning, or access external knowledge bases.
*   **Not Real-Time Data:** The script's text-based user interface (TUI / CLI) and its knowledge base are **static**. It **does not generate real-time data**, connect to job market APIs, or adapt its advice based on current trends beyond what is explicitly programmed. The advice reflects the rules present at the time the script is run.
*   **Simplistic Model:** This is a basic demonstration of an expert system concept. A real-world career advisor would require a much more complex knowledge base, nuanced rules, and potentially integration with external data sources.
*   **No Validation Against Schema (in default code):** While a schema (`it_career_advice_schema.json`) is provided, the default Python script does not actively validate the output against it (though code comments show where this could be added using `jsonschema`).

## JSON Output

The script generates JSON files conforming roughly to the structure defined in `it_career_advice_schema.json`. Each file contains:
*   `session_id`: A unique identifier.
*   `timestamp`: When the session started.
*   `initial_prompt` & `user_decision_space_input`: The user's goal.
*   `outcome`: A summary of the session result.
*   `interactions`: An array detailing each question, the options presented, and the user's answer.
*   `final_advice`: The text advice generated by the script.
